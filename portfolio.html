Hello. My name is Elliott.
          <br><br>
I trained and worked as an actor and musician until the spring of 2020, when the world stopped, and my industry stopped with it.
          <br><br>
3 years earlier, I was asked to create a logo for a new musical a friend of mine had written. I had been drawing and designing for years as a hobby, and discovered it could be something more.
          <br><br>
Over the following years, I countinued to work in theatre, but took commissions and freelance work when I could, honing my skill and knowledge, diving in to find how I might fit into the world of art and design.
          <br><br>
I taught myself to code, learning what I needed as I needed it, exploring what was possible. I studied color theory and the design process, experimenting with personal projects. When I had a few moments to spare, I would get lost in new ideas, challenging myself, just for fun.
          <br><br>
And then, as the pandemic began, I found myself without my chosen field. And I was left with my fun.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <div class="text">
Since the beginning of 2020, my time has been spent shaping my new path around the passions I pursue, and skills I display, on a daily basis. I am a problem solver seeking problems to solve.
          <br><br>
Every day, I work to solve small problems I see everywhere. And I find that it is best (and frankly, most fun) to use any and all resources and tools to help develop and optimize solutions. I have solved graphic design problems, in my own projects and commissioned work; developing clear communication of ideas and ideals, while moderating clients' hopes and expectations. I have worked in html, javascript, and CSS, learning, as I worked, designing systems to provide greater usability and discoverability. I have used geometry and statistics to analyze situations and hone in on the best and most efficient answers to complex problems, and sought to improve and optimize answers I wasn’t entirely happy with.
          <br><br>
The world of UX and Product Design fascinates me. The empathy necessary for working in user centric design comes naturally to me. I find digging for a problem, and assessing how it can be iteratively improved from the perspective of the user, endlessly engaging.
          <br><br>
It’s all about the path of least resistance. Which may not always be the quickest, but the one that makes the user feel understood and respected. My experience and study of theater gave me a handle on the empathy necessary to put myself in the shoes of a user. I learned about the psychology of why people do what they do. This empathy helps design systems that give the user easy access to everything they need, nothing more, nothing less, but where anything else they want can be found if they go looking for it.
          <br><br>
Welcome, and thanks for visiting. Take a look at my gallery to see a sample of my work and to get a sense for my kind of creativity.

          Through ideation and experiementation, I disocvered a handful of alternatives to the standard layout, most of which weren't improvements.

          The Narrative
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="text">
            In January of 2020, while working at an archery range in Brooklyn, I learned that many archers use playing cards for target practice. They are cheap, easy to find, and work as a great substitute for standard paper targets, while giving the extra challenge of being much smaller and harder to hit. I realized that the intricate symmetrical designs on the backs of standard playing cards were the perfect place for a design that resembled a classic archery target, letting the archers get the best of both worlds. I began working on the design, and decided to also loop the front of the cards, the pips and numerals, into the design language of the card backs I had been working on.
          <br><br>
            One of my favorite design details from anything anywhere is the rotational symmetry of playing cards. The fact that the cards can be in either orientation, totally shuffled, and still stay balanced and usable is so beautiful and simple to me. But, while working on these cards, I quickly discovered that that truth I held dear was false. Playing cards… are not perfectly rotationally symmetrical.
          <br><br>
            With that awful revelation still haunting me, I set to work building something better.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="text">
            There are 2 main issues.
            Here's the first:<br><br>
            - on odd numbered cards, there is a single pip left over that doesn't have another to pair with, so you can't make a perfectly mirrored layout<br><br>
            This has a simple solution: place the remaining pip in the center of the card. This means it maintains its location in both layouts.
            Unfortunately, this is where the second issue comes in:<br><br>
            - the pips themselves aren't totally symmetrical, so a single pip becomes upside-down when the card is in a different orientation<br><br>
            Frustratingly, this is also true for a few even numbered cards. The 6 of each suit, for example, could easily be made to be perfectly symmetrical, but often isn't!
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="galbox">
          <div class="gallery">
            <img src="imgs/design/binary/center7.png" style="height: 200px"><!--
        --><img src="imgs/design/binary/normal6.png" style="height: 200px">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="text">
            Again, there is a simple solution: if each individual pip was the same in both orientations, both even and odd cards would work.<br><br>
            I worked for some time, iterating new pip designs that had that vertical symmetry. There seemed to be some nice opportunities, particularly with the legs of the black suits. But even when I had made designs I was happy with, they just weren't quite right. There is something so special about the classic designs, that it feels like you lose something by changing them so drastically. I also found that they were each harder to identify like this, having less differentiating details between them.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="galbox">
          <div class="gallery">
            <img src="imgs/design/binary/doublepip6and7.png" style="height: 200px">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="text">
            So with all that, our one-pip-in-the-center plan doesn't work.
            But, I've narrowed it down to one crucial constraint:
            <br><br>
            - each card must have an even number of pips
            <br><br>
            At first, this seems like a lost cause. By nature, only half the cards would have an even number of pips (and in fact, if we include the jack, queen, and king for a full 13, only 6 are even, and 7 are odd).
            <br><br>
            Here's simple solution number 3:
            <br><br>
            - we mirror the full pip layout on both ends of the card
            <br><br>
            Interestingly, this option is largely infallible. Using the standard pip layout, and doubling it, it solves all our issues. There are no left over pips with no pair, each upside-down pip is balanced by an opposite right-side-up pip, and we get to use the classic pip designs with no problem.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="galbox">
          <div class="gallery">
            <img src="imgs/design/binary/mirror6.png" style="height: 200px">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="text">
            But just like with the new pip designs, this one just doesn't look right, and falls away from the primary purpose here: recognition. The doubled layout is messy and crowded, and it's hard to tell quite how many pips you're looking at, particularly when you get to higher numbers. With this layout, there's just too much going.
            <br><br>
            This made me realize 2 things:
            <br><br>
            - the elegant balance of a standard card design is a huge part of its success<br>
            - The number of pips on the card might not be that important...

            When you look at a playing card, how do you work out which card you're looking at? Do you look at the numbers in the corners? Do you count the number of pips? Do you recognize the shape the pips make?
            <br><br>
            Of those three, the answers to the first and third questions don't really matter. But I'd be willing to bet your answer to the second was "no." And that is huge. If the exact number of pips don't matter, then all we need for recognition is the numeral, and a layout of pips that is unique for each card.

            When we doubled and mirrored all the pips on each card, our problem was mostly solved. The real issue with doubling is that you end up with too many pips. Instead, we can still double and mirror, but display the numbers with less pips, by counting in binary.

            Some fresh (but classic) pip designs, a font that borrows from the same design language, and some flourishes to jazz up the card-back design, and we've arrived: a new deck of cards with its own special, perfectly symmetrical layout.

            Each card has no more than 6 pips, and each has a unique formation, meaning that each card has is own identifiable visual pattern to be associated with its number.
            <br><br>
            And no matter the orientation, no matter how vigourously you shuffle the cards, the deck will always be identiaclly recognizable, and perfectly, inperceptably balanced.
