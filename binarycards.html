        More about this project:
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        This has been a passion project of sorts, and one I've worked on for a long time. This was a fun puzzle to solve, and one that I got wrong a good amount before finding a solution I was happy with.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        Only 6 of the 13 unique ranks in a deck of cards are actually rotationally symmetrical. There are some simple ones, like the face cards, and the 2 and 4 for example. Noticing which are already symmetrical makes it easy to see one of the mains hurdles with changing the rest: odd numbered cards. Having one extra pip that doesn't have a pair is tough for symmetry. Particularly if you follow the rules established by standard card layouts, with each card having it's number of pips.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        But one of my primary frustrations with card symmetry is that it isn't confined to just those odd numbered cards. Some even numbered cards, that could easily be designed to have symmetrical layouts, fail to do so, seemingly deliberately so.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        Not having a comprehensive knowledge of the history of plying cards, I imagine there is a reason for this, and likely an interesting one. 
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        There are a handful of little details here that I'm proud of. For example, because the pip notation can be displayed in one vertical line, it can fit neatly under the numerals, displaying all of the cards information in just the top left corner, so it can be easily seen when holding a full hand of cards. This is a feature I might inlclude in a future version.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        I don't know that I would try to suggest that my idea is better than the standard, and an argument could be made for not wanting to stray so far from such a well known established standard. It's also true that having "fixed" one issue, I have introduced another, in that you have to be "taught" how to read these cards, where the standard design is intuitive, requiring you only to count.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 16px"><br>
        That said, this was a fun exercise, and discovering how well the binary numbering applied here was an exciting moment, so me that propelled me to the finish line.
